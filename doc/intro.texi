ASynK allows two-way sync of Contacts across any two supported sources. For
e.g. you can use this to copy contacts from one Google account to another, or
from your Google account and your official MS Exchange account etc. 

@item
ASynK is the only two-way synchronization option for BBDB known to be in
existence today. So if you are keen to keep your BBDB content synchronized
with a mobile device or Outlook, look no further.

@item
ASynK works on Windows, MacOS X, and Linux. Outlook synchronization
only works on Windows.

@item
Synchronization is granular to the level of 'Folders', i.e. you can
synchronize one folder of Google Contacts with a Outlook folder (on Windows at
work, say), and another Google folder in the same account with BBDB (On your
Mac, say)

@item
The infrastructure is there to add more database and item types (i.e. tasks,
notes, etc.), but currently only Contacts synchronization is supported

@item
It is free software, and released under the GNU AGPL (Affero GPL)
version 3
